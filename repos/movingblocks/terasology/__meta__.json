  "description": "Terasology is an open source project started by Benjamin \"begla\" Glatzel to research procedural terrain generation and efficient rendering techniques in Java using the LWJGL. The engine uses a block-based voxel-like approach as seen in Minecraft.  After proving itself as a solid tech demo begla was joined at first by Anton \"small-jeeper\" Kireev and Rasmus \"Cervator\" Praestholm and a full-fledged game concept was born. Our goal is a game that pays ample tribute to Minecraft in initial look and origin, but stakes out its own niche by adopting the NPC-helper and caretaker feel from such games as Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, while striving for added depth and sophistication in the foundation systems akin to DF.",
