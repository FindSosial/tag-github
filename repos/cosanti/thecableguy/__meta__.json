  "description": "The CableGuy tool can be used to check the network topology - any missing 'cable-connections'. This application does the following: (a) takes the expected topology in the .DOT file format as input. (2) Obtains the topology information from the ODL using the rest-APIs (c) Compares the two topologies and displays and missing/lost \u2018cable-connectivity\u2019. Currently the application is customized for ODL-controller, and only physical-toplogy. In future, we plan to enhance it to cover multiple-controllers, and also the virtual-network topologies.",
